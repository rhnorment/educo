  The Rivendell Program offers an “all-inclusive” college experience. There are four total semesters in the
  program. Our goal is to be as cost effective as possible for our students while offering a high value program
  including features such as study abroad, cultural events, etc. We feel these included features are not only
  beneficial, but essential in equipping exceptional students to become extraordinary citizens.
