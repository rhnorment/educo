  At San Diego Christian’s Rivendell Program, our first priority is to offer a superior education; our next
  priority is to make it affordable. We are doing everything we can to keep costs low while holding fast to
  high standards. The Rivendell program utilizes outside donors and partnerships to offer financial aid to our
  students who demonstrate individual need. Our admissions counselors will work with you to build a financial
  aid plan specific to you and your family’s situation. There are numerous financial sources that will help
  make the Rivendell program affordable:

  <ol>

    <li>Federal financial aid (FAFSA school code: 012031)</li>

    <li>Minnesota financial aid (FAFSA school code: 012031)</li>

    <li>Parent contribution</li>

    <li>Student savings</li>

    <li>Private loans</li>

    <li>Rivendell institutional aid</li>

    <li>Affordable payment plan options</li>

    <li>Lifetime Learning tax credits</li>

    <li>Hope/American Opportunity tax credits</li>

    <li>Veterans benefits (MN GI Bill, Post 9/11 GI Bill, etc.)</li>

  </ol>
